# Research on FixMatch

> FixMatch is a combination of two approaches to SSL: Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. Its main novelty comes from the combination of these two ingredients as well as the use of a separate weak and strong augmentation when performing consistency regularization.

Under this project:

- Implement FixMatch algorithm from scratch.
- Implemented different architecture of convolutional neural networks such as
  - VGG â€“ 16
  - Resnet-50
  - Resnet-34
  - Google net
- Compared the how the algorithm worked on different architectural models
